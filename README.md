# Markdown Previewer

Markdown Previewer allows you to enter markdown in the left pane and shows you a preview of the corresponding HTML in the right pane. It's styled using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (via [Bootstrap Vue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/)) and compiles the markdown using [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked). This project is based off of [this guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-markdown-previewer-with-react-js/) from freeCodeCamp.

You can try the application here: [Markdown Previewer](https://camdecoster.github.io/vue-markdown/).
